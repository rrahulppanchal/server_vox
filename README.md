## Installation

To get started with Server Vox, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rrahulppanchal/server_vox.git
   ```
3. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd server_vox
   ```
4. **Install dependencies:**
   
   ```bash
   
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the server, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server on the default port (specified in the configuration). You can then access the server's API using your preferred API client or browser.

### Development

For development purposes, use the following command to start the server with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Configuration

Configuration options are available in the `config` directory. Modify the necessary files to adjust the settings according to your environment.

- **Database**: Configure your database connection in the `.env` file.
- **Server Settings**: Adjust the server port, environment, and other settings in `config/server.js`.
- **Security**: Configure security settings such as JWT secrets, password hashing, etc., in `config/security.js`.

## Database Setup

Server Vox uses PostgreSQL as its database. You can easily set up the database using Docker.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.

### Running the Database with Docker

To start the PostgreSQL database, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Docker is running on your machine.

2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of your project with the following content:

    ```yaml
    version: "3.9"
    services:
      db:
        image: postgres
        restart: always
        ports:
          - "5432:5432"
        environment:
          POSTGRES_USER: vox
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: vox
          POSTGRES_DB: vox40
        volumes:
          - ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ```

3. Start the PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

   This command will pull the PostgreSQL image if itâ€™s not already available, set up the database with the provided credentials, and start the service.

4. Verify that the database is running correctly:

    ```bash
    docker-compose ps
    ```

   You should see the `db` service up and running on port `5432`.

### Connecting to the Database

You can connect to the PostgreSQL database using any PostgreSQL client. Use the following credentials:

- **Host:** `localhost`
- **Port:** `5432`
- **Database:** `vox40`
- **User:** `vox`
- **Password:** `vox`

### Stopping the Database

To stop the database service, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove the PostgreSQL container, but the data will be persisted in the `./data` directory on your host machine.
